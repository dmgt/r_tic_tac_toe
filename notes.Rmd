## Notes
- Taking in input from the prompt is not a functionality I have used before in R, but it definately exists (see eg packages built to provide in-IDE tutorials from an R package such as `swirl`)

### Sample function 
```{r}
# Sample function 
prompt_user <- function()  {
  n <- (readline("What's your move? Please enter a number from 1-9: "))
  n <- as.numeric(n)
  
  list(n=n)
}

tic_tac_toe <- function ()  {
  inputs <- prompt_user()
  if (inputs$n > 5)  {
    print("Input >5")
  }
  else  {
    print("Input <= 5")
  }
  inputs$n
}
```
